    <p>
        Here is one of Dae Gak's poems:
        <div class="epigraph">
            <p>
              <strong>
                Put On Your Robe
              </strong><br><br>
              Put on your robe, your gown, your dancing shoes, your vestments.<br>
              Pray.<br><br>
    
              Not to someone or something you have been taught about<br>
              But to what you know and feel and live in each moment.<br><br>
     
              Find what your heart already knows<br>
              Not what your thinking believes about it.<br><br>
     
              Find your tears, which flow without end<br>
              Where there was once only blame and disappointment.<br><br>
     
              Find your friends, your lovers,<br>
              Your breath, your parents<br>
              From ten thousand life times.<br><br>
     
              Find your True Self and never let go.<br><br>
     
              Hold the question without conclusion.<br><br>
    
              And breathe, breathe into the belly of this beast<br>
              whose heart is loss and whose intelligence is not knowing.<br><br>
     
              In a little over one hundred years everyone who is on earth today will be gone.<br><br>
     
              There is no enlightenment other than... This!
