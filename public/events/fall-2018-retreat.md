The cost of the full retreat is $200, or $180 if we receive your completed registration by August 20.  Separate from the retreat fee you are encouraged to make a contribution, known in Buddhist tradition as *dana*, as a sign of appreciation for the work of the teacher.

Please consult the <a href="/documents/LZC_Retreat_2018-09-14.pdf" target = "_blank">registration form</a>, which includes information on what to bring to the retreat, where to mail your registration, etc.
