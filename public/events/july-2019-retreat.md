The cost of the full retreat is $180, or $90 if you only plan to attend on Saturday.  Separate from the retreat fee you are encouraged to make a contribution, known in Buddhist tradition as *dana*, as a sign of appreciation for the work of the teacher.

Please consult the <a href="/documents/LZC_July_2019.pdf" target = "_blank">registration form</a>, which includes information on what to bring to the retreat, possible arrival times if you only plan to attend on Saturday, where to mail your registration, etc.
